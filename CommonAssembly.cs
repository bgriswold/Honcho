// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]

// The AssemblyVersion is used by the CLR to bind to strongly named assemblies.
// It is stored in the AssemblyDef manifest metadata table of the built assembly, 
// and in the AssemblyRef table of any assembly that references it. 
// Take care when changing the AssemblyVersion as it may impact referencing 
// assemblies.
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("0.1")]

// The AssemblyFileVersion is intended to uniquely identify a build of the individual assembly
// Ideally we would have the build server update this value. This version number is stored 
// in the Win32 version resource and can be seen when viewing the Windows Explorer property 
// pages for the assembly. The CLR does not care about nor examine the AssemblyFileVersion.
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("0.1.0.0")]

// The AssemblyInformationalVersion is intended to represent the version of your entire product.
// The CLR does not care about nor examine the AssemblyInformationalVersion. You will find this
// value represented as the assembly's product version in Windows Explorer.
